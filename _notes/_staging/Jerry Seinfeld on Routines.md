#Business #Life 

Jerry Seinfeld credits his success to the routine which he is able to do every day. The more routine that you have, and it hasn't changed over time. If you don't write, then you're not going to survive ([[You don't need to be smart to be a doctor anymore#^657913]]. The wellspring of his ideas comes through his irritabilities in life, and he writes about them. I think I also need to write about them to get them out of my head. Keeping a book to write observations is important so you don't forget them. 

1. Winners and losers have the same goals - all that matters is putting in the work every day
2. If you have a goals-first mentality, then you'll always be thinking about the result. If you think about the process, then you will always love the process. 
3. Systems drive results.

Confronting people when you are dissatisfied with their performance is the best way to not have consternation or resentment. In order to increase your odds of success, try and systematize it downâ€”the brain is a dog to be trained. After you have written something, don't share it until you have 24 hours under your belt. He has a policy of desk to stage back to desk for the rewriting and using the data that people give him to write better. Writing is hard and it takes a lot of mental energy. You should reward yourself after it is over. Weightlifting and meditation also help his routines. Pain is knowledge rushing in to fill a void at a great speed.

You just have to survive to be successful. Survival is the new success. Jerry's billboard would say "just work," because that is his philosophy.
