#Unfinished #Healthcare 

Subscription models will take over services in healthcare to unbundle them. Just as we have seen in music (Spotify), productivity (Asana, other team-based softwares), subscription models will take over chronic home care and other convenient healthcare elective amenities. You can pay for different home care services, while living with a chronic disease. It provides a way for better preventative care and better ways for physicians to check up on patients since they can't do it well right now through the EHR  ^b3eade

>**We’re about to witness an explosion of DTC chronic condition management companies** that will focus on conditions characterized by frustratingly poor access to quality care.

>**1\. Monthly fee for platform access**, likely paid for by the consumer. This includes anything lacking a CPT code or otherwise not reimbursable, such as asynchronous texting, disease education, etc. Some companies may convince employers to cover these fees. Over time, we might see additional CPTs created to cover more services, shifting fees to payers.
>**2\. Billable services sent to insurance**. Anything with a CPT code (i.e. telehealth visits) or otherwise billable through fee-for-service reimbursement systems (i.e. medication delivery) will eventually be paid by insurance, if it’s not already.

>**Eventually, payers will recognize “virtual-first providers” as simply “providers”** and contract with them in similar ways. Not every self-insured employer will need to approve every virtual provider; the payer will maintain a network of in-person _and_virtual providers. Of course, DTC providers will need reimbursement to expand their market size. But, by building a brand and consumer-friendly technology first, these companies are laying the groundwork for rapid consumer adoption once more expansive payer contracts are in place.
