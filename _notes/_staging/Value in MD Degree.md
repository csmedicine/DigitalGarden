2. Colleges are there to be appraisers of value. The only way that it helps medical students is throught the network that they meet and the signaling that it offers. [[90% of People don't do their job well]]
>**Sheepskin Effect**: For example, if Student A is one credit short of a Bachelor's while Student B has earned their Bachelor's degree, then the two students have essentially the same amount of education. However, according to the sheepskin effect, Student B will earn a greater income than Student A.
3. Residencies are important signaling values - if you are a dermatologist, you can signal more value than a person who is trying to become a family practice physician. People use education to compete for a relatively fixed pool of applicants, directly so in medical school for residency positions. This signaling helps customers and also employers to acquire the "best" human capital. 
5. Medical school provides value inefficientlyâ€”you have the M.D./D.O. but you need to jump through hoops to become one (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3). To build for the value proposition that you're offering residencies human capital, you need to: 
	1. Provide them with the knowledge of toold which they will use in clinical practice
	2. Provide them with a network that they can use to work in the specialty that they choose
6. if you were trying to build better clinicians you would have them get up to speed in terms of learning the language of medicine in a year (with a robust knowledge of statistics and tools used in modern medicine) using an online learning system and using the rest of the time practicing with clinicians and their peers on relevant projects like community service, policy efforts, or clinical affairs. 
7. **How would it make money?**
	1. Through marginal-capped income sharing agreements where the student pays through their future salary and does not have to worry about not being able to afford their tuition. This incentivizes the medical school to have some skin in the game.
