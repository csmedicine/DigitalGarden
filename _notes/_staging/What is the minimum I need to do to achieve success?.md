Instead of trying to get the best possible score on something, be more focused on actually doing the work. Without doing the work, you're not going to succeed. [[90% of People don't do their job well]] Even though people are bad at their job, it doesn't mean that they aren't trying. Their minimum is probably less than yours. In any target, you need to make sure that the target that you set is the acceptable point with which you will stop trying (i.e. STEP Score or specialty). [[Compound Interest Matters in Good Habits and Bad Habits]]

You can do this via [[Pick up what they put down]] strategy. This is all about taking what other people see as not worth or too hard and doubling down on it [[Mr. Beast's Advice for YouTube]]

>Instead of being a perfectionist about the paper, be a perfectionist about _writing_ the paper. Be a perfectionist about identifying good strategies, about abandoning sunk costs, about killing your darlings, about noticing when you're done. Be a perfectionist about wasting no attention. Be a perfectionist about learning from your mistakes. Perfectionism can be a powerful tool, but there's no need to point it at overachieving on metrics you don't care about.
