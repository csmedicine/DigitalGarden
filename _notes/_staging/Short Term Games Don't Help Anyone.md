Climate change is exacerbated by people who don't play long term games [[Don't end the week with nothing]]. We are left to clean up the mess when we do not design systems which are anti-fragile (see [[You don't need to be smart to be a doctor anymore]]). One of the problems which I saw in this article, which talked about how wells would be abandoned in the coming years, is that the mineral land right structure was designed in such a way to increase short term profit for the gain of the corporation (who got all of the land underneath the surface) while the people who were living on the land were only entitled to the surface land.
