# Notes from Healthcare digital transformation

- Even though health systems know that tele-health is the future, wait times and clinical unprepardness (physicians not being trained) is a bottleneck for patients being seen.
- Reimbursements for remote patient monitoring (RPM) needs to be more robust as we scale the digital health capabilities of health systems.
- All buildings may need to see repurposeability in later years (i.e. Ghost kitchens can be transformed into restaurants into food shelters, etc)
- Reduced travel will help with reducing carbon emission which may pave the way for the reversal of climate change
- How do hospitals make money? They make money through being a cross-subsidized business. They make money on the commercial side of business (employer-provided insurance or under parts of government-run program). They lose money on Medicaud and Medicare, nto to mention uninsured populations with no abiity to pay. The commercial population is helped with preventative care (**which is most ripe for disruption**)
    - They do this by ensuring simplicity and convenience, while lowering costs and increasing engagement
- Falling reimbursements and consolidation have left little discretionary costs to spend on technical debt. A fee-for-service system is a margin-constrained system, and it has a conundrum because preventative healthcare cannibilizes revenue from in-patient hospital stays and other aspects of traditional healthcare model.
    - Chronic care is becoming more virtual - people are not staying in hospitals, so they are not generating revenue from hospital beds. Telehealth will evolve to treat chronic needs and limited mobility ([One stop shop for payment, treatment, etc delivered to door](https://www2.relatient.net/a-digital-front-door-strategy-what-it-is-isnt-and-why-you-need-one/)) ^f1a4b6
    - EHR Data, especially unstructured data, social determinants of health (SDOH), and claim processing systems are being analyzed to see what can be done about different conditions
    - Data interoperability is still a challenge because people do not want to share their data
