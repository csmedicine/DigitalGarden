Vivek Ramaswamy is the executive director of Roivant Sciences. I think he is a great value-add to the podcast because he has a new way of managing a biotech company, that I haven't seen other people do. He built a shell company of different pharmaceutical companies. He's done it at a young age, but I think that is besides the point. I want to get him on because of his book, but I want to make 3-5 clips which I can take away and show that I can do research on the biotech industry and healthcare. 

Remember to use princiiples found in [[How to Ask Good Questions]]

Some research which I have found out which I would like to explore
- 1st question: why did he write his book about "[stakeholder capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/WOKE-INC-Corporate-Americas-Justice/dp/1546090789)"? 
- His early life in [St. Xavier's high school](https://www.stxavier.org/) revolved around him playing tennis - He has a Honorable mention in the newspaper (Cincinnati Enquirer), along with doubles - work life balance? 
- Ran a [business in college](https://www.pdsoros.org/news-events/2020/03/18/paul-daisy-soros-fellow-vivek-ramaswamy-s-roivant-sciences-develops-clincical-stage-antibody-to-prevent-and-treat-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-ards-in-patients-with-covid-19) which was acquired in 2009 - how did that show him to be a good CEO? 
- He went to Harvard at the same time as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - His whole point of stakeholder capitalism says that Big Tech should not get involved. Getting involved requires the CEO to take a stance on an issue. How should free market rule in this situation? Does the book go into depth about this? 
- One of his articles talked about finding a replacement for president summers in the wake of his comments about [men vs. women in the workplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers#Differences_between_the_sexes) - How does he believe CEOs should navigate these particular situations? 
- In his time at QVT financial he invested in 2 companies with Hep C drugs - what did he look for there? Why Hep C? It seems different than your core hypothesis at Roivant but still found value in what he was trying to find. 
- When he was [trying to get funding](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/this-millennial-wants-to-build-the-berkshire-hathaway-of-biopharmaceutical-companies-can-he-pull-it-off/), what did he use in his book of observations to net a 100MM deal as a 28 year old? 
	- Founded in 2014, Roivant—the “Roi” stands for “return on investment”—is parent to a family of subsidiaries that staff members lovingly call “vants.”
- When Theranos was getting all of the bad press, he was staying quiet and working—how did he weather through the failure of the Phase 3 drug of Axovant and what did he learn from that? 
- What did he learn from the [deal which went down with Sumitono](https://www.biospace.com/article/more-details-on-the-3-billion-roivant-sumitomo-deal/) and how to negotiate? Why is now the right time? 
- What is your decsision making framework to decide whether a drug is worth investing in? What goes into it? 
- One of the things which I struggle to address about his ideas is his insistence that we have a voice in Congress to deal with some of the views which are brought about by the idea-fixing that is going on in silicon valley. Famously, Orrin Hatch made a statement which showed that senators are clueless about how Facebook even works. We are here 10 years After Citizens United, which ruled that corporations are people and can speak out about issues that they value. Why shouldn't corporations, then, given the precedent, answer to their employees and customers as stakeholders to advocate for issues which benefit their own community?
