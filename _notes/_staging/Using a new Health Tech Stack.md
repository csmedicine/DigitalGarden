#Healthcare #Business 

Three different ways that health can be set up using inter-linked businesses is through front office administration, back office administration, and care delivery services: 

>**Care delivery services:** e.g. clinical operations, virtual consults, ancillary services (e.g. labs, pharmacy)
>**Back office administration:** e.g. revenue cycle, credentialing, supply chain management
>**Front office administration:** e.g. scheduling, registration, payments and e-commerce, customer engagement

In order to be successful, they have to make sure to have: 
>-   **High-volume areas of transactions **to engender stickiness.** Example: Ribbon focuses on the billions of financial, administrative, and referral transactions that occur every year amongst virtual-first care companies that require some piece of data about physicians.
>-   **Connecting multiple stakeholders where integration is non-trivially challenging.** It’s the intersections between stakeholders in healthcare that are often the most challenging to build against, but also where network effects can be generated. Example: Eligible connects providers with payors for automated transactions that have historically required faxes and phone calls, and where APIs don’t readily exist.
>-   **An executable path for selling to incumbents over time.** Eventually, even the legacy players will adopt virtual-first care models, presenting a means to significantly expand the addressable market for these healthtech companies. Example: Wheel’s virtual clinic platform enables digital health companies to build flexible telehealth capacity, but can also be used by incumbent providers and payors as they spin up virtual care programs that may be challenging to staff through traditional means.
