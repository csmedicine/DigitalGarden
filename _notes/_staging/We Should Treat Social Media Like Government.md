[[Mr. Beast's Advice for YouTube]], [[Pick up what they put down]]

YouTube is as powerful, if not more powerful than govenrments. We need to regulate it through creator pressure and government regulation. We have unelected leaders which can change different processes (algorithms) inside the system to silence people of their free speech. Also, employees and advertisers (who are their customers) need to take a stand against YouTube for it to change. 

>We’ve seen all of these systems accomplish some change. There are ways to exert some small amounts of influence on the leaders of our new governments. As long as they have this amount of power (or, as I think is likely, even more power) we’re going to be living in a world where we are no longer customers, we are citizens. And we will have to start acting like it, even if it is not the world any of us wanted or expected.
