#Business #Random

I just had a random thought where I thought of a rapper which took all of his references from Shivaji Malsure. I thought that it would project an image of a ruler who is also tolerant, and it would combine my love for rapping and my admiration of Shivaji. It would have a lot of marathi references, and I might call the rapper Baji for Bajirao I. The first album would be called Raigadh, and I think it would be interesting to tie in different parts of Indian and American history into the lyrics.
