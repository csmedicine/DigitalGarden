#Philosophy 

Integrity is a risk that we take every day with our present self that our future self will have those same values which we have right now. It is a form of self-integration, which allows us to be intact and uncorrupted. We are steadfastly true to our own commitments rather than holding many different types of endorsing desires. "Commitment" means that we are whole in all of our convictions, and relationships of trust and expectations. We live as if our public life and private life are congruent.
