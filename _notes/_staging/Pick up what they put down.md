>**Who's "they"?** Anyone you look up to, anyone who knows more than you in the thing you're trying to learn. If that's still too broad for you: Look for the maintainers of libraries and languages you use, or the people who put out YouTube videos, podcasts, books, blogposts and courses.
>**What do you mean by "put down"?** Any **new** library, demo, video, podcast, book, blogpost, or course that _they_ put out. It is important that it be **new**. By virtue of it being **new**, it is simultaneously at the top of _their_ minds, and also the most likely to lack genuine feedback.
