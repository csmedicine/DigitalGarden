# Link List

I wanted to make a place where I could refer to things which I found useful for Common Sense Medicine but I didn't know where to put yet. I didn't want to keep this in Notion because it's not a script, per say, but I want it to be robust enough where I can refer back to this page and find tools which I found useful at some point in time and I'll write why it was useful. **I will publish this on the blog when I get at least 10 links in here. ** ^edff85

1. [Side Hustle Stack](https://sidehustlestack.co/podcaster) - I thought this was useful because it had a list of businesses that I could use to monetize the podcast. I would like to use Skillshare to make a BS/MD course which people might use. 
2. [Mental Pivot](https://mentalpivot.com/about/) - I thought this blog was very insightful and had a lot of the ideas that I wanted to convey in my writing, also he seemed very consistent with his writing habit. [[Don't end the week with nothing]]
3. [[How to Ask Good Questions]]
4. [Cold Outreach - How to](https://www.notion.so/An-Ode-to-Cold-Outreach-6d7dd3ba3f5844188158d31dee7c36eb)
5. [Founder Library](https://www.founderlibrary.com/)
6. [How to set up a business (if you're starting from scratch)](https://sweatystartup.com/essential-tools/) - I thought this blog put it very simply things I would want to improve on for Common Sense Medicine, and it gives a good way to get started if you're just starting a common business which isn't scaling through the use of media (maybe in the college consulting space if you're trying to build something local). 
7. [[How to Grow an Email List]]
8. [How to make a podcast media kit](https://www.thepodcasthost.com/promotion/how-to-make-a-podcast-media-kit/)

Spaced repetition idea (use it for lectures so people could get ahold of the ideas like they do in Boards and Beyond but with more active learning with it)
