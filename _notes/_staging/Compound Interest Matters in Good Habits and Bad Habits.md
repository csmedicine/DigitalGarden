#Life #Habits 

Productivity Compounds, just like how everything else in life works. In life, good things compound - you need to help others and then they help you back. You need to leave your ego at the door and put in the work in order to see the success. People don't gte things by taking most times they get by putting in the work. 

Likewise, one bad meal won't kill you but multiple years of bad meals will. Bad thinking won't stress you out but multiple days of thinking will be a loop. You have to believe in yourself and do nice things for people to see the compound interest. You don't see it in a day. [[You don't need to be smart to be a doctor anymore#^657913]]

A habit is split up into **cue, craving, response**, and **reward**. The cue and craving are part of the problem phase and the response and reward are part of the reward phase. 

>How can I make it obvious?
>How can I make it attractive?
>How can I make it easy?
>How can I make it satisfying?”

If you notice a bad habit? 
>1\. Who am I with? 2. What am I doing right now? 3. Where am I? 4. When is it? 5. What emotions are driving my actions?

>“As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”
