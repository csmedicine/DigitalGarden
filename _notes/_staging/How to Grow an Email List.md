1. Delay welcome emails by 45 minutes to bypass reflex of signing up
	1. Send the email from a person, not the business (Julian Shapiro is more human than Julian.com)
	2. Use Unique subjects rather than "Welcome"
2. Make it seamless to refer - remind readers at the end of each issue that they can refer others. Include a link. Have a web version of every issue so they can easily be shared outside of email. 
	1. Consider rewards: Send a monthly bonus issue for referring 5 friends
3. SEO can be a vanity metric if it doesn't convert to leads
	1. Offer quizzes to identify the ebst products for them. Require an email to see results. 
	2. Create Buyer's Guides: Make PDFs with nice visuals to help readers learn skills. Require an email. 
4. When pitching your newsletter on your site: 
	1. Show a sample issue on the page to prove how high quality your content is. [[Don't end the week with nothing]]
	2. Give control over how often they get emailed. Some want weekly, but others REALLY want monthly. High volume can burn you and your readers out. 
5. Non-payment causes 50% of churn. When a card fails, retry it. 20% of payments are resolved on attempt #2. 
	1. No work? Email customers a mobile-friendly link w/ no password needed to update the card. 
	2. No response? Send an SMS. 
6. Make each newsletter really count. Value over quantity. 
7. After newsletter signup, send subscribers a sample issue: Piece together your best content from past issues into a super issue. This gets them anticipating your next issue, and makes them less likely to insta-unsubscribe once they get it. 
8. Make emails funâ€”not just educational. Consider injecting a few memes, jokes, or interesting links from around the web. Give readers a dopamine hit upon opening your email. [[Delivering Value in Emails]]
9. When pitching Twitter followers to become newsletter subscribers, two ideas: 
	1. Obvious: Link in Bio 
	2. Less obvious: Cut a tweet thread short and tell people to subscribe for the rest of the threads' insights.
