# The True Impact of Medical School

Everyone thinks you have to be very smart to go to medical school. This is, at least in the current day, a lie (particularly in the first two years). I don't speak for the other two years that I haven't been through, but at least the first two years aren't very challenging as they relate to problem-solving ability. Sure, you have to learn a lot of new words, and associate things with each other, but the type of learning that is done isn't anything *novel*. 

Unfortunately, the more I learn about the world, the more I think that this type of knowledge becomes increasingly useless over time. A lot of dubious things have been taught at medical schools in the past, so it is a reasonable assumption to say that some things that I am taught today may be different 10 years from now when I have been in practice for a few years. While medical school professors are well-intentioned, they live in an increasingly fragile ecosystem, trying to design courses for a dynamic world. 

I'm reminded of a scene in *House of God* by Samuel Shem, where the main character learns he has to do everything the opposite of what the rules are to succeed. Real world knowledge, like how likely someone is to die after learning about a cancer diagnosis or how accurate the test is, is important to answer. We don't learn anything about the cost of treatment either so it's a real handicap when going out into the world. But while the uselessness of [basic science is known in medical school](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mLepDy84HurgDgNx8LoM0kP0kiu4lYNb/view), I think it is exactly what I need in my life at the moment. 

Learning anything, by any means, takes *hard work*. If you look on YouTube (where I can spend up to 12 hours a day) and search "productivity," you'll be bombarded with self-help videos. Littered among the used-car-salesmen-esque videos touting "the one trick to help you become 10X productive," there's actually some useful content. As mentioned by medical students across the platform, spaced repetition (particularly through Anki) and active learning does most of the tricks of jamming associations into your brain. I myself have talked about these strategies. But it doesn't discount the *work* which requires you to get up and do them.

This work, in turn, requires focus. While I said medical school knowledge may not be relevant, the focus aspect definitely is. *If only*, I think to myself as I get out of my bed in the morning, *if only I could stop thinking about startup ideas, or MrBeast, or YouTube videos*, I could get back to work and be productive. But being productive is a particularly difficult thing to measure. It's easy to report test scores and hours studied, but it's harder to measure true *focus*. Which is why the study strategies on YouTube help. But for me, the thing that is most helpful from these two years is teaching me the art of studying, rather than the subject matter itself. 

Thinking by writing, like this, forces me to reckon with this *loss* of focus. It's hard to remember a world where everything wasn't virtual, of Zoom calls and Twitter DMs and Podcasts and Technosolutionism, but reclaiming focus is not only "vaguely helpful," it's essential to any definition of success. Whatever definition of success you optimize for, you need to build in the time to focus. Want to become an entrepreneur of the next Facebook? Want to become a professional athlete? Want to become the next Einstein? You have to focus.

Focusing, in fact, may be my least favorite thing. I [can be a donkey](https://sive.rs/donkey) most of the time, staring at the food and water pail, not knowing what to choose until I die of starvation. But these two years have definitely brought me in close contact with it—I have seen how fragmented my attention has been; how quickly I jump to other thoughts. I realize, as I get closer to my dedicated study time, that I haven't payed enough attention to it: I realize I need to cultivate it like a muscle, every day. In clinical practice, the patient isn't going to ask me about the gene which codes for Neurofibromatosis II, but there may be many differents patients to manage which may pull my focus. 

Brute force works up to a point for focusing—it's like an addiction that you have to beat. For me, the time for focusing is growing shorter, but everyone has the same 24 hours. Losing focus could be disastrous for my career in medical school. I'm glad that I'm focusing on improving on this part of me now, rather than in 30 years, because without the daily practices of focus, it's tough to imagine a world in which I could succeed as an entrepreneur. Like any addiction, I don't think the strategies of studying are the problem that I have but rather the *focus* that is the issue. Distractions come and go, and I have to learn to be okay that if I can't do everything in one day, it's okay. Rather than brute forcing my way through, riding the wave of distraction and pushing through is better. 

Like a million other articles on the internet, being focused is valued and is rewarded in the attention economy. You don't need to be smart to do well in medical school, but you need to have a lot of discipline. I don't particularly think you need to pay to achieve this level of focus, but it is a good reminder that everyone has the same 24 hours to study the things that you do. The focus is unevenly distributed. Getting rid of unwanted thoughts, while doing the same stupid thing over and over (like answering questions on the Krebs cycle) is hard, but doing hard things with focus to build rare and valuable skills pays off (a la Cal Newport). 

This is where the value of the first two years of medical school pays off in the clinical world. Sure, you can get this knowledge elsewhere, definitely for cheaper ($0!) outside of medical school. Building this level of focus doesn't necessarily require pitting everyone against each other for grades, standard deviations, and residency slots - but having some skin in the game does definitely heighten the urgency to find this focus, especially for me. I've been trying to find my optimal stress level for a while, and it seems like I've definitely pushed it to the limit in college, where I started studying for finals the day before just to get a kick out of it. It was unhealthy and brought so much unneeded stress. Unfortunately, this same addictive thinking pervades my habits today.

Routines are made years in advance of success, and compound interest takes care of the rest [[Compound Interest Matters in Good Habits and Bad Habits]]. This is easy to say, harder to practice. Breaking the cycle just requires constant reflection, meditation, on the fact that this focus is necessary to becoming a good physician and entrepreneur, two of the goals which I have set out to accomplish. This instant gratification is something that needs to be broken- and I realize that now. I will try my best, every day, to rope in this distraction in order to not be fooled by the pseudo-productivity of checking my e-mail or liking Tweets, but rather working on my craft and crushing whatever project I'm working on at the moment. We are creatures of habit and primed to do something every day. I think the value that I've gained from medical school in the first two years is coming to terms with that. The mind can be a terrible master, truly. Changing this part of me will require a practioner's mindset, and not be fooled by the fleeting thoughts which can seem "smart," but are not "disciplined."
