**My dad just told me that valentine's day is in a feww days and asked what I was doing for my first one ever. I knew it was coming up, and a part of me was waiting for Shree to say something about it.** 

Feedback: I have to be more vocal about holidays before they happen. I'm not only responsible for my own happiness but also to strengthen others. I can check whether there are any holidays coming up in that week and ask Seema if she is free that day before. 

**I feel like recently I've been the only one asking to hang, and I end up feeling guilty for asking which I know I shouldn't feel that way.**

Feedback: If you want to hang out, then let's hang out. I don't see the reason for doing it so frequently because I want to do my own thing for more time aka chill by myself. But if I was to imagine a worldview where this view fits in, I would say she wants to "hang out" by doing different activities together like the virtual game room. 

**But I'm realizing that he probably doesn't even know that I want to celebrate it. Maybe it is because he still doesn't know me that well, but I am starting to realize that we never really do much of anything together, and that is not who I am. I like celebrating holidays and making new memories, but I feel whenever we hang, it is always the same. I want more.**

Feedback: What is more? She wants to celebrate holidays and gifts. She wants to celebrate. How can I do that? I just forgot all of this because I'm pretty shit at planning for long-term. I just want to know what the right thing to say is but I keep forgetting the holidays. It's just procrastination and then I forget the holiday until it's too late and she reminds me or surprises me with her own gift. I have to have a calendar with all of the holidays so I can remember them before she does. 

**I want to go on dates and I want to celebrate holidays with him. I love holidays. I always have. I love giving and getting gifts (only when they are a surpsie - I on't like being told about them because that just sets my expectations up). And I love having any reason at all to celebrate.** 

Feedback: She wants more dates and wants more gifts. This is understandable, because I haven't gotten her any for Christmas or Valentine's Day. This is a mistake which I can fix. Which holidays are gifting holidays? Which aren't? 

 Or I wish he would have suggested studying together on valentine's day. I wish he would have said that he would takee the night of my birthday off to spend with me. My love languages are quaity time and gifts and I feel like that is why my dad mentioning valentine's day affected me. Celebrating holidays together is quality time for me, and giving each other gifts on those holidays is another way I feel loved. I feel like right now, it is mostly just love through words of affirmation, which is my last love language. **I feel anyone can sat that they love you, but it's how they act and if they think about you and taking that extra step to make you happy that counts in my mind. I want him to take that extra step.** I know step is coming up soon, but post-step, I hope that this is something that we can work on together. Maybe that means having scheduled date nights where we do something new each time, and take turns planning it? Maybe that means that I need to be more upfront with him about the days that are important to me?
