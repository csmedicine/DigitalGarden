Cannabis is a good alternative for opioids in some aspects. However, card-mills only pay physicians if they end up giving the patient a card. Therefore, the physician is incentivized to give out a card. This can be harmful for patient and provider. Also, the state doesn't get the revenue because the patient gets the marijuana tax-free if they have a card.
