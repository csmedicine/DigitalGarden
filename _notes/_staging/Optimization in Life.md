#Writing #Life #Unfinished 

# What is the plan, Shree?

Today was a low point in my life. I woke up and I didn't want to get out of bed this morning. I never felt like that, but I guess it was coming for me. I keep thinking that someday I will feel like that guy who I keep seeing in my dreams, but that day won't come. I need something else propelling me into action, a credo. A manifesto. There comes a time in a man's life where he stands up for what he believes in; he has to make his mark on the world by being *himself*, and no one else. 

What's stopping me from doing that? Why don't I wake up every day and do that? What is stopping me from being original, and wanting to change the world? Why do I stay in bed and accomplish none of the tasks that I set out to do that day? Sitting here, writing these things, I know the answer lies in entitlement, fear, cowardice, and shame. Entitlement that I **will** go to a residency, USMLE score be damned. Fear that I **won't** live up to my own high expectations. Cowardice that I **can't** reconcile my past failures, so I won't try for other things. And shame that this has become a part of my daily life. The vices that I continue to engage in, day after day, these things are making up a rolling average of my life. I don't want this to become my life. I am becoming what I fear most--wasted potential. I am boxing myself into a hole where I feel safe, where I am always right, and I can do no wrong. This is a mistake.

## What do you want to optimize for in your life? 

It's very easy to make it seem as though life is plotting against you, Shree. It's easy to stare at what can be in five, ten years from now. But you're living now, and every day you plot against yourself, and how you hate where your life is going, is another day of your life wasted. Life is happening. It's passing you by. And you're in the passenger's seat, watching the mile markers go. There's 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. Your Jordan year's coming up. The ball is in your court. Would you rather take it, and run with it? Or would you want to lie back, and say that you can't rise up and be a man and take responsibilities for your actions? In life, there are no good or bad experiences, but thinking makes it so. 

Let us take a step back, Shree, and think what is important to us at this very moment. I want to send you this letter in the future, on a random Tuesday after you match, and try and remember this moment. Right now, I imagine that Shree—he is happier, healthier, and in a better place than this Shree. Is that true? Will that actually happen? It is only in your mind where this happens, which individual actions you decide to take on each particular day. I don't want to optimize for faiilure, that's for sure. I know that family is important to me. I know that my friends are important to me. I know that freedom is important to me. I know that social media is **not** important to me. I know that experiences are fun, that I want to experience life and be healthy enough to do that. 

You can't optimize for everything. It's hard to do that when the word literally means to focus on something at the expense of most everything else. I need to focus—right now, I am becoming a physician. This means I have to focus on it to the exclusion of everythiing else. I can talk with my friends but the reason you cannot become a startup evangelist or a health policy scholar is because you have no rolling momentum for that. You can't stop focusing on one thing to move on to the next because you're bored. 

I keep coming back to this focus because it's sad that
