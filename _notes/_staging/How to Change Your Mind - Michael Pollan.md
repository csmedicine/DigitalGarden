Summary 

LSD AND psylo cibin are drugs which were made in the 50s. The author didn’t know much about them so he didn’t really think much of it he wants to try them and he says that it can help in older age. They may help change crystallized thinking patterns and see the world in a new light. Psychedelics are becoming more mainstream. This can also be seen in different RCTs which are taking hold across different institutions. Psychedelics means mind manifesting, which is accurate although it has a lot of cultural baggage associated with it. 

There were three seminal events that happened in 2006: one was the centinneal of Albert Hoffman’s death, 2 was the legalization of ayuhausca for religious ceremonies, and 3 was Roland Griffith’s experiment about psilocybin and mystical experiments came out. He had been interested in this topic since he had started liking meditation retreats in 1994 but he couldn’t do anything about it because it wasn’t scientific. This changed when he met Bob Jesse and Rick Doblin who founded the center for legalizing MDMA. These two men formed an unlikely pair when combined with Griffiths which would increase scientific study into psychedelics. 

Psychedelics open up a part of us which we cannot explain through regular science and erase the part of us which feels doubt, which can point to a Noetic quality - this ego death can provide secrets to change fundamental notions about how our consciousness may not be just defined by our brain. 

Bob Jesse spent the rest of his time in the 1990s trying to read more about the different trials of the 1900s which had been done with psychadelics and connected with others who were interested in psychedelic research. However since the studies (I.e Good Friday experiment) were not well controlled, they need to be redone in the present. 

Esalen institute was a way for people to take guided lessons with LSD but now only teaches breath work. This is led by Stan Grof. Bill Richards is a clinician who talked about how psychadelics had impacted him and his clinical career - they helped him understand the world and he also set up Spring Grove psychadelics center to study them. However he thinks that because of the societal effects they went underground again (“There is so much authority that comes out of the primary mystical experience that it can be threatening to existing hierarchical structures.”)

When Bill Richards and Roland Griffith made the first experiment, they were able to prepare the people who joined for a mystical experience. The mystical experiences described were otherworldly, and the people were so enamored with how the drug worked—it was like magic (some of the stories are crazy! But so exciting)

William James, in his book the Varities of Religious experience, talks about the four concepts of a noetic experience: ineffibility( can’t describe it), Illuminatous (unforgettable and shows something), transiency (stays with you), passivity (you’re being shown something by a higher power). These experiences may not make much sense to others, but they offer a powerful way to evaluate psilocybin on a n=1 basis (they are true to the individual and they talk about how it changed their life in a positive way). There are detractors, which is to be expected, however delirious patients don’t necessarily talk about delirium the same way. 

Psilocybin is a mushroom, which as a fungi makes the psychoactive component. Paul Stamets is a preeminent mycologist who can find these mushrooms in the Pacific Northwest. R. Gordon Wasson was the first one to characterize the power of these mushrooms, which the Catholic Church sought to push underground because of how it challenged their authority. What follows is a discussion from Michael Pollan about finding Psilocybin mushrooms and having an otherworldly experience with his wife Judith. I won't say much about it here, because his words describing his experience are such a good advertisement for taking it to just try and see the "other side" held by the "filmiest of screens." I don't know whether these are the best ways to describe such mind-altering substances, but maybe I am like Pollan himself, reluctant to see whether these experiences can, in fact, show us parts of our reality that our ego suppresses, and that there is life within nature. 

The next chapter opens up with the proponent of the LSD movement in the 1960s, Timothy Leary, trying to escape federal indictment from his role in marketing LSD to the masses. It seems as though Leary was the impetus for starting to understand how LSD worked, and his departure is the end of research in LSD in the 60s, but that isn't remotely true, Pollan argues. Rather, there were many researchers who worked on these topics before Leary came along, with his larger-than-life personality. 

Psychedelics were first called psycho-mimetics and they were used to study psychosis and schizophrenia. Therapists would take it to see how their patients felt when they were in psychosis. This caused some researchers to open the study into neurotransmitters and neurochemistry. One researcher named Humphrey Osmond started using it to treat alcoholics and simulate delirium tremens to convince them to be sober. It worked in 1/2 of the cases. This was a shift from psychology only measuring the changes which they could see and measuring the things that were on the inside and what people felt. When trials were conducted with people who were in controlled settings they did not feel as good as those who were in the safety of a good room and guided through the experience. Also, it was used by Bill W. When he first made Alcoholics Anonymous, but the board didn’t like it saying that it would mess with their branding. 

Sidney Cohen was another practitioner in the US who proposed to use it in clinical trials. As a psychiatrist he was able to see it in action. He didn’t see the psychomimetic theory play into action; but rather had lots of pleasure. The paychomimetic theory gave way to the psychadelics and psycho lytic theories. Then because of its popularity, it increased in usage by the Los Angeles elite who marketed it to the rest of the US at the beginnings of the 1960s. This made Cohen, who was a man of science, uncomfortable because he thought the drug was gaining a cult of religious nature. This made him feel “uncomfortably unscientific”. The other theory of psychadelics came from Huxley and Osmond which showed that rather than loosening the mind it amplifies thoughts which are already in your mind. This opens your “doors of perception,” which is how mystical appearances arrive in your mind. 

Basically this new way of thinking was called psychedelic, or "mind-manifesting" and was a very new way of thinking—no one had thought of psychedelics in this way (it was a neologism as well). Al Hubbard, a very interesting and mysterious man who has an eclectic history, was one such person who this new way of thinking appealed to—and he was able to bring this way of thinking into the forefront by introducing LSD to people in power. Hubbard did so by understanding the importance of set and setting in his work; he was able to bring traditional therapy of medicine to the shamanism of the East and combine the two. Hubbard went farther than *just* science, trying to change LSD from just a fringe drug to treat alcoholics (which he financed, and often ferryed people up to Vancouver for treatment, earning the nickname "Captain Trips.") to a cultural revolution. He introduced Huxley to this idea that LSD could be used not only for patients but also for society at large. 

Hubbard also introduced this drug to Silicon Valley through an executive called Myron Stolaroff. This engendered a huge culture shift in Silicon Valley among engineers to develop new patterns of thinking; it also spurred a lot of research into how psychedelics worked in the human mind. It could be argued that some parts of Silicon Valley are a result of Hubbard's LSD trips with his patients. 

# **Part II: Crack-up**

Timothy Leary was a person who became very bored with science, but he was introduced to psychedelics and this changed dramatically—he was able to really revive his  interest for psychology and the mind. He was able to convince Harvard to approve a project which would allow him to teach the secrets of LSD to his students through "expanding their consciousness." He wasn’t very good at experimental design and his experiments were debunked.
