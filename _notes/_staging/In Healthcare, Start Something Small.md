#Healthcare #Business 

Every business in healthcare is either a **tool** for business, a **therapeutic**, or a **diagnostic** technology. 

As a tool, it is all about streamlining operations by X% for a health system, how you can lower patient length of stay, patient cost, reducing readmissions, or being metric-driven. You need to be able to produce evidence that your tool works pretty quickly, because [[Hospitals are a low-margin business]]. In order to find this, you need to make sure that you have a physician colleague which can show you the inefficiencies of the system [[90% of People don't do their job well]] ^decbd4

For a therapeutic, you need to make sure that it goes through all of the process. It needs to go through Phase 1 --> Phase 4 and you need to make sure that you can continually monitor patients. You need to also make sure that you are **empowering patients** to be more compliant with their therapeutics by engaging them to see what is working and what isn't [[How to ensure better patient compliance]]

Finally, as a diagnostic tool, it's all about preventing disease (think of a CGM for a people who don't have diabetes, like [Levels Health](https://www.levelshealth.com/)), or laboratory derived test for fast-tracking approvals. 

Unfortunately, you need to partner with clinicians for proof-of-concept testing for all of these. Pilots can be expensive. This is a pain point for many physicians. You have to use a clinician to make sure that.  ^5dbfd9
