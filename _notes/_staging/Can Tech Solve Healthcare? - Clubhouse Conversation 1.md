w/ Abdullah and Revanth

[[Tech and Medicine Don't Work Synergistically]]


- Revanth - one thing that I am working on at Amazon is how to translate the unstructured data from the doctor notes to store them in the cloud using the FHIR framework (it is a schema in which people store data like JSON)
- The problem is that not many people are using that framework so it becomes hard to put it on the cloud. One of the problems with data in healthcare, that I added, was that you need to partner with an organization in order to make sure that you have enough data and proof-of-concept to make a company (based on your value proposition).
- I mentioned that it is hard for people to start companies in medical school because its hard to take a gap year in order to start a startup; Rutgers doesn't have a good infrastructure to support student-entrepreneurs (also I have STEP 1) [Starting a Company in Medical School](https://shreenadkarni.com/notes/starting-a-company-medical-school/)
- Then, we went on a tangent with how the country could achieve single payer in a feasible timeframe (I mentioned that this could happen through Medicare Advantage plan). This could happen in a reasonable time frame and we could have HSAs for elective coverage (although this a pipe dream). I mentioned that my dream is to have health data decentralized but this is hard to do when the revenue stream of Epic, Cerner is built on having patient data.
- I also want to have independent providers, and not have consolidated health systems which hinders the competition aspect of how cost lowers. Rajul mentioned about the MIPS disadvantage, namely that patients who would be seen as big risks would not be treated, and this is why we need price setting. I argued that this could be fixed with value-based pricing, and could also be done using price transperancy (not by itself though).
- People keep healthcare confusing in order to make money (PBMs, etc.) and we need navigation to help patients make sense of it (especially for those who interact with it a lot - elders, chronic care management) [[SaaS models in Healthcare#^b3eade]]
- Tech can definitely help with this but it is also causing some of the problem (Zoom fatigue, etc.). We ended the conversation with talking about how the next conversation could be structured, less topics but more focused on the intersection of health and technology and research more about how the system works (because we are pretty clueless) [[90% of People don't do their job well]]
