#Life #Business 

Don't end the week with nothing. Move forward on 

(a) social capital - where you can reach out to a friend and have them recommend you/work with them 

(b) human capital - gained a skill and wrote about it 

(c) created capital - created a video or a blog post or learned in public. 

It underscores the idea of "proof of work," an idea of cryptography which shows that you did your research and you did the work along with it (showed that you have gone through the process). Work on small improvements every day and then you will see results.
