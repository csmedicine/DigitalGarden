One of the ways to ask good questions is to know what the person is like before asking the interview question (e.g. knowing that they were born in Chicago and then asking, How was life like in Chicago?). Asking tough questions is important, but make sure that they aren't antagonistic but try to uncover some humanity in your subject. Mostly, interviewers are trying to gain perspective on something. You want to ask questions to start a conversation.  ^3d55ad

>Good interviewers are simply themselves. They’re not acting. They’re curious. They know how to be quiet and listen. The authentic ones who ask good questions are the ones who extract profound answers instead of clichés, and who get past the surface and into something that rarely gets explored.
