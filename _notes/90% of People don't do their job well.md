90% of people don't do their jobs efficiently because it doesn't interest them. It's not to say that they can't do it well, but that their talents aren't optimized to work in the particular job that they have started. This is true for physicians too. In [Dallas Buyer's club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Buyers_Club), [Matthew McConaughey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey) is a AIDS patient who is given a high dose of AZT (Zidovudine) but he doesn't get better, he has pancytopenia. He is given a death sentence. He starts importing drugs across the border and then he starts curing himiself. This is one example of how doctors might not know what is best for their patients.  ^ab5f9a
