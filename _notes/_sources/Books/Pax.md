## Highlights
That had hurt a lot, but he’d only cursed through the pain waiting with the coach for X-rays. Man up. But today, twice. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=312) ^ref-23306

---
“Good,” his grandfather replied, not bothering to hide the relief in his voice. He left, closing the door behind him firmly as if to say, You can have this room, but the rest of the house is mine. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=343) ^ref-52234

---
Peter learned to avoid being that something. Learned to stay out of his way. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=355) ^ref-26317

---
Peter’s anxiety began to stir. All day, the whole ride here, Peter had sensed it coiling. It always seemed like a snake to him, his anxiety—waiting just out of sight, ready to slither up his spine, hissing its familiar taunt. You aren’t where you should be. Something bad is going to happen because you aren’t where you should be. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=360) ^ref-3146

---
He saw himself where he should have been: keeping watch in the garden that night. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=401) ^ref-2632

---
Since that time, whenever his boy was gone, Pax would pace his pen until Peter returned. And at night he always whined to come inside, where he could listen to his human’s breathing. Pax loved his boy, but more than that, he felt respon-sible for Peter, for protecting him. When he couldn’t perform this role, he suffered. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=460) ^ref-17328

---
It stank of diesel and the same charred metal scent that had clung to his boy’s father’s new clothing. In a cloud of dust and sprayed stones, the truck charged past, followed by another and another and another. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=492) ^ref-25466

---
In the dugout, the familiar mingled scents of leather, sweat, and stale bubble gum wrapped around him like a hug. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=545) ^ref-43971

but distrust is no match for kindness administered consistently and unmeasured, especially in creatures new to the world. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=562) ^ref-11226

---
Peter sensed that the shortstop understood about that holy calm, was feeling it too, right now. — location: [651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=651) ^ref-42821

---
Had the nice therapist known all along he’d been angry that last day, that he’d done something terrible? That as punishment, his mother hadn’t taken him to the store? And did she blame him for what happened? — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=674) ^ref-38370

He pushed in a good safe thirty feet, until the saplings rose up taller than he was, until his anxiety let him breathe right again, before turning to parallel the road. It — location: [707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=707) ^ref-11772

His right foot caught on a root and he fell. He heard the bone break—a soft, muffled snap—at the same time he felt the sharp stab. He sat panting with the stunning pain for a long moment. Finally he pulled his foot free and unlaced his boot, wincing at each motion. He eased down the wet socks, and what he saw made him gasp: his foot was swelling so fast that he could actually see it. — location: [740](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=740) ^ref-2543

There is a disease that strikes foxes sometimes. It causes them to abandon their ways, to attack strangers. War is a human sickness like this. — location: [841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=841) ^ref-12551

---
“And you’re going to do this no matter who tries to stop you? Because it’s the right thing for you, at your core?” Vola made a fist and thumped her chest. “Your core. Is that true?” — location: [1071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1071) ^ref-24292

---
What would it feel like to make something so . . . so consequential? To cut timbers and watch them fall out of a clear blue sky and roll them down to a clearing, your hands sticky with sharp-scented pitch, and then to lift them into place, notched and stacked one over another—yes, just like the toys that had been his favorite in kindergarten, the old set in the tall cardboard canister—and end up with a home. “You built this?” — location: [1118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1118) ^ref-60421

---
Because I am exactly where I should be, doing exactly what I should be doing. That is peace. Eat.” — location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1198) ^ref-36944

“Just wondering,” she said. “You staying out here on the porch. What do you suppose that makes you? Wild or tame?” — location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1243) ^ref-36863

---
Pax closed his eyes against the low-glancing sunlight and did not respond. Runt bounded off and came back a few minutes later with a worm hanging from his jaw. He dropped it at Pax’s paws. — location: [1268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1268) ^ref-14506

---
Runt was gone, but in a few moments he came back, two more eggs held carefully in his mouth. Pax devoured them. Runt left and returned twice more. Pax ate steadily, until finally, seven eggs swelling his shrunken belly taut, he dropped to the sandy apron in front of the dens and closed his eyes. Runt leaped onto a gnarled root above the dens. He drew himself up to his full height. And while Pax slept, the ragged little runt kept watch. — location: [1287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1287) ^ref-8801

“She always wore it. She’d hold her wrist up so I could play with it when I was a baby. I don’t remember that, but I’ve seen a picture. I do remember her telling me about it, though. About the charm, I mean. It’s a phoenix. That’s a special bird. It’s red and gold and purple, colored like sunrise, and it—” — location: [1309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1309) ^ref-4054

She said it meant that no matter how bad things got, we could always make ourselves new again.” — location: [1319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1319) ^ref-27691

---
what if he was like his father, with that threatening kind of anger, the kind that was always simmering, the kind that could boil over at any time and hurt everyone in the way? The apologies afterward never healed the damage. — location: [1352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1352) ^ref-21405

---
He heard his grandfather’s words now—our apples don’t fall far from the tree—and he felt sick and afraid all over again. He dropped his gaze to the worn pine table to hide the shameful headline he felt burning across his face. — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1390) ^ref-24948

“No-bat Peter, those are just things I figure to be true about the world. The universals. The important ones are the things I figure out to be true about me. I keep them somewhere else, private.” — location: [1414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1414) ^ref-44494

---
Peter figured he knew what was coming. “Like war. Now you’re antiwar, right?” Vola steepled her fingers under her chin. “That’s a complicated thing. What I am is for telling the truth about it. About what it costs. People should tell the truth about what war costs. — location: [1462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1462) ^ref-53876

---
It hung between grief and yearning, and it welled from a deep ache for something that Pax could never divine. — location: [1488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1488) ^ref-61837

---
Gray had not gotten better. When the old fox reached the spicy shade of the hemlock bough, he collapsed. His eyes were hollow and glazed, and he barely flinched when Pax cleaned his neck once more. — location: [1671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1671) ^ref-22215

---
Pax lay down shoulder to shoulder with the old fox, pressing tight in full company. He could offer only withness, but nothing else was asked. — location: [1727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1727) ^ref-39645

that paper dragon who was too wise to go flying off into the air when so many other adventures were waiting for him on the ground. — location: [1887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1887) ^ref-23196

The wind eddied, bearing smoke from the west. He’d smelled it twice on his way, but now it was thicker, more dangerous. Closer. — location: [1911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1911) ^ref-39727

---
It was a valuable thing, he suddenly realized, to have someone you could count on for honesty. How many times in his life had he wanted only that? How many questions had he needed an honest answer for and gotten instead, from his father, dark silence? — location: [1997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=1997) ^ref-1802

---
Peter watched her gather up the chicken feathers and tuck them into a pouch. And it struck him: nothing would change after he left. Vola would save her feathers, would make her puppets all alone in the woods, more and more and more of them, and tell that soldier’s story to no one. — location: [2046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=2046) ^ref-57087

---
And the other bad memory swept him. His seven-year-old fury. A wildness he couldn’t control. The exhilarating fright of that wildness. His mother’s blue gazing globe, batted off its pedestal into a million shards. Her tears—“You’ve got to tame that temper. Don’t be like him.” Her bloodied fingers, picking the blue glass daggers from her white roses. His shame as he watched her drive away. — location: [2275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=2275) ^ref-28836

---
We all own a beast called anger. It can serve us: many good things come of anger at bad things; many unjust things are made just. But first we all have to figure out how to civilize it.” — location: [2294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=2294) ^ref-47641

---
So they named me Vola—it means ‘fly’ in Italian. But they called me Ti Poul—‘Little Chicken.’ “My chickens grace me with feathers, and I wear them to remember that when I was born, someone saw me as a bird. That’s all, not much of a story.” — location: [2318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=2318) ^ref-56866

“You knew.” He shoved the toy soldier into his pocket and picked up the fox leg. “You knew! And you did this! Pax!” — location: [2734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=2734) ^ref-57669

Together, the two foxes looked expectantly at Pax, and then they melted into the underbrush. And Peter understood. His fox belonged to them. And they belonged to Pax. Inseparable. All this way he’d come. All this way. Peter got to his knees. He placed his hand on Pax’s back and felt the muscles jump. Peter looked around. The woods looked dangerous now, full of coyotes and bears and, soon, humans at war. He looked down at his fox, still straining to follow his new family. “Go. It’s okay.” It wasn’t, though. The pain scoured him hollow, left him without breath, like a kick to the heart. He pulled his hand away, because Pax would feel a pain that deep and he wouldn’t leave. “Go!” Pax shot away toward the brush line. Then he turned back to look at his boy. Peter felt tears roll down his face, but he didn’t wipe them away. Pax sprang back. He whimpered, licking at the tears. Peter pushed him down. He found the crutch and levered himself upright. “No. I don’t want you to stay. I’ll always leave the porch door open, but you have to go.” Pax looked toward the brush and then back at his boy’s face. Peter dug into his pocket and pulled out the toy. He lifted it. Pax raised his head, his eyes trained on Peter’s hand. And Peter hurled the plastic soldier over the brush and into the woods, as far away as he could. — location: [2794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y87XMUQ&location=2794) ^ref-53378
