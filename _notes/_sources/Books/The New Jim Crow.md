## Highlights
The racial dimension of mass incarceration is its most striking feature. No other country in the world imprisons so many of its racial or ethnic minorities. The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid. In Washington, D.C., our nation’s capitol, it is estimated that three out of four young black men (and nearly all those in the poorest neighborhoods) can expect to serve time in prison.9 Similar rates of incarceration can be found in black communities across America. — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0067NCQVU&location=298) ^ref-8076

Between 1960 and 1990, for example, official crime rates in Finland, Germany, and the United States were close to identical. Yet the U.S. incarceration rate quadrupled, the Finnish rate fell by 60 percent, and the German rate was stable in that period.15 Despite similar crime rates, each government chose to impose different levels of punishment. — location: [318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0067NCQVU&location=318) ^ref-36687

This book argues that mass incarceration is, metaphorically, the New Jim Crow and that all those who care about social justice should fully commit themselves to dismantling this new racial caste system. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0067NCQVU&location=395) ^ref-29052

It may be helpful, in attempting to understand the basic nature of the new caste system, to think of the criminal justice system—the entire collection of institutions and practices that comprise it—not as an independent system but rather as a gateway into a much larger system of racial stigmatization and permanent marginalization. — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0067NCQVU&location=415) ^ref-35762
