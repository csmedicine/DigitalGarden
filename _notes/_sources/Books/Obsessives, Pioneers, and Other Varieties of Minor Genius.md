## Highlights
call minor geniuses — not Einstein and Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela and the other towering architects of the world in which we live, but people like Ron Popeil, who sold the Chop-O-Matic, and Shirley Polykoff, who famously asked, “Does she or doesn’t she? Only her hairdresser knows for sure.” The second section is devoted to theories, to ways of organizing experience. How should we think about homelessness, or financial scandals, or a disaster like the crash of the Challenger? The third section wonders about the predictions we make about people. How do we know whether someone is bad, or smart, or capable of doing something really well? As you will see, I’m skeptical about how accurately we can make any of those judgments. — location: [52](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002ROKQHO&location=52) ^ref-64232

Our instinct as humans, after all, is to assume that most things are not interesting. — location: [84](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002ROKQHO&location=84) ^ref-19889

Good writing does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. Not the kind of writing that you’ll find in this book, anyway. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else’s head — — location: [108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002ROKQHO&location=108) ^ref-52761

separate product development from marketing, as most of their contemporaries did, because to them the two were indistinguishable: the object that sold best was the one that sold itself. — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002ROKQHO&location=136) ^ref-21477
