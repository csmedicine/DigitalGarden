## Highlights
why Americans, who were wary of medical authority in the early and mid-nineteenth century, became devoted to it in the twentieth; how American doctors, who were bitterly divided and financially insecure in the nineteenth century, became a united and prosperous profession in the twentieth; why hospitals, medical schools, clinics, and other organizations assumed distinctive institutional forms in the United States; why public health did not; why there is no national health insurance in the United States; why Blue Cross and commercial indemnity insurance, rather than other types of health plans, dominated the private insurance market; why the federal government in recent years shifted from policies that encouraged growth without changes in the organization of medical care to policies that encouraged reorganization to control growth; why physicians long escaped from the control of the modern corporation, but are now witnessing and indeed taking part in the creation of corporate health care systems. — location: [169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C0QQ&location=169) ^ref-9630

Some may think the sources of professional sovereignty too obvious to be worth pursuing. For haven’t healers always been esteemed and powerful? And doesn’t the growth of science make inevitable the high value and position attached to medicine? — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C0QQ&location=282) ^ref-28731

Authority, in its classical sense, signifies the possession of some status, quality, or claim that compels trust or obedience.4 As part of this ability to compel trust or obedience, authority signifies a potential to use force or persuasion, though paradoxically authority ends when either of these is openly employed. — location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C0QQ&location=348) ^ref-31413

The more administrative uses the state and other institutions find for professionals, the more they may simultaneously expand and undermine their authority. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C0QQ&location=396) ^ref-45235
