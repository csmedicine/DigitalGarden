## Highlights
In fact, the system known generally as U.S. Healthcare isn’t a single casino at all, but a combination of three distinctly separate ones. The first is the insurance casino where coverage is sorted largely based on ability to pay. The second is the delivery casino where specialized care is actually received and the third is the pharmaceutical casino—where — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=102) ^ref-58485

pricing for life‒saving drugs is so variable (based on ability to pay) it might as well be a slot machine. In the pharmaceutical casino, even though health insurance is likely to include a drug “benefit,” that’s not always the cheapest way to buy the prescription drugs you may need to stay alive. — location: [104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=104) ^ref-13313

Healthcare, in every part of the world, is expensive, so the only way to avoid the enormous and personal financial risk associated with unforseen and unintended personal healthcare expenditures is with a system of pooled risk, or health insurance. In general, there are only three types of health coverage that a country can implement for an entire population. The two biggest are universal health coverage (UHC) and selective health coverage (SHC). The third type is really the absence of either UHC or SHC, and it’s no formal system at all. Many emerging or third world countries are stuck with this last one strictly by their limited economic capacity. Healthcare in these countries is typically threadbare and Government-provided or donated, and largely free to the general population through State-run hospitals and clinics. While it’s not formally recognized as a term, I use SHC as a way to compare it to the only other alternative—UHC. That, in turn, is critically important because the U.S remains the only industrialized country with SHC. In fact, every other industrialized country has adopted UHC. — location: [211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=211) ^ref-9852

The effect is that we’re all paying for this particular game of 3‒card Monty—not once, but twice. Once through the higher premiums for our own insurance coverage, and then again through higher taxes as an offset to the reduced taxes paid by hospitals. Hospitals don’t simply provide ANY care through their emergency department, but they are legally required to provide “an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital’s emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists.” — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=375) ^ref-8161

The effect of EMTALA as an unfunded mandate has been so severe on some hospitals that they’ve been forced to simply close their emergency department altogether. The rate of these closures has been on the rise. According to a JAMA study released in 2011, the number of Emergency Departments (EDs) in metro areas from 1990 to 2009 declined 27%—representing a net loss of 667 ED’s. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=393) ^ref-63784

There’s clearly a rich and colorful history to our system of selective health coverage, but it’s not remotely a function of design as much as evolution. No one sat down and said “as a country, this is what we need and want.” The system isn’t broken; it’s just struggling under the enormous weight of patches and legislative band‒aids like Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, EMTALA, and COBRA that evolved over the decades. — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=415) ^ref-4432

Private Payers, Medicare, and Medicaid (unlike L.E.K., they simply omitted the uninsured as a 4th category). With cost represented at 100%, Private Payers deliver about 40% profit, but Medicaid and Medicare are both negative, at about 10%. The volume of Medicaid, Medicare (and uninsured) negative margin is what dictates pricing (and requisite profits) through Private Payers, but it’s largely designed to simply keep the doors open (or return a modest 4% average profit). — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=556) ^ref-10740

The demand for pricing transparency makes us feel good, but that feeling is falsely based on the assumption that pricing is egregiously high everywhere—and that simple visibility will foster competition and swift pricing correction. It won’t. This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t make systemic changes to low‒acuity, primary care—we absolutely should, and many of these are either here or in the pipeline. Retail clinics, telehealth with online consults using primary care physicians or nurse practitioners, and smartphone‒based clinical support are making important contributions and will have an impact, but the ROI timeline is long. Even in combination, any economic gain of these efforts is easily eclipsed by the annual growth of healthcare spending (about 4-5% through 2024). — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=591) ^ref-56211

“Before his three-hour neck surgery for herniated disks in December, Peter Drier, 37, signed a pile of consent forms. A bank technology manager who had researched his insurance coverage, Mr. Drier was prepared when the bills started arriving: $56,000 from Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, $4,300 from the anesthesiologist and even $133,000 from his orthopedist, who he knew would accept a fraction of that fee.” “He was blindsided, though, by a bill of about $117,000 from an ‘assistant surgeon,’ a Queens-based neurosurgeon whom Mr. Drier did not recall meeting.” “I thought I understood the risks,” Mr. Drier, who lives in New York City, said later. “But this was just so wrong—I had no choice and no negotiating power.” — location: [726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=726) ^ref-34485

name: the AMA / Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee. Today it’s known less formally as the Relative Value Scale Update Committee—or simply RUC (pronounced “ruck”). There are 31 doctors on this committee and they are associated with all the different specialties that healthcare represent. Specialties like dermatology, neurology, pediatrics, radiology and family physicians each have a representative member. — location: [863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=863) ^ref-10753

10.  The entirely opaque formula that the RUC uses for all its “value” recommendations is proprietary (meaning they alone use it) and includes a final, mysterious calculation called the “conversion factor.” — location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=885) ^ref-41486

1.    America is the only industrialized country that uses this type of health insurance coverage. 2.    Pricing is totally opaque in almost every direction. 3.    In an attempt to reign in spiraling healthcare costs, employers are pushed further and further into the business of actually managing healthcare delivery. 4.    As difficult as a 3-party system (payer, provider and patient) is to navigate and manage, a 4-party system is simply impossible without major compromises to one (or more) constituents. — location: [1099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=1099) ^ref-64797

Third year student, already over 300K in debt, will hit lifetime Stafford amount next year which means most of 4th year will be grad plus loans at higher rates. Nothing is subsidized for grad students anymore so the debt grows exponentially. My spouse is also in medicine, and while in a little better shape than I, in a year and a half we will begin life making a combined ~100K with ~500K in debt before we’ve bought a house, had a kid, put a dime towards retirement, or traded in our POS cars. My family and friends already assume we’re rich, and if they have anything at all to say about finances and medicine, it’s that doctors make too much money. — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EVBQGM4&location=1216) ^ref-14832
