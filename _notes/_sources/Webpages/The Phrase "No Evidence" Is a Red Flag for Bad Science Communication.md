- You can see the problem. Science communicators are using the same term - “no evidence” - to mean:; This thing is super plausible, and honestly very likely true, but we haven’t checked yet, so we can’t be sure.; We have hard-and-fast evidence that this is false, stop repeating this easily debunked lie.

- Their point was that "evidence" isn't the same thing as "peer-reviewed journal articles". So maybe we should stop demanding journal articles, and accept informal evidence as valid?

This is interesting - how do we define evidence?

- start with a prior for how unlikely something is. Then you update the prior as you gather evidence. If you gather a lot of strong evidence, maybe you update the prior to somewhere very far away from where you started, like that some really implausible thing is nevertheless true.
